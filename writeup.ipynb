    "\n",
    "To identify lane line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial, I used the following algorithm (see LaneFinder class [lanefinder.py](lanefinder.py) (line 113, 198, 210)\n",
    "1. Convolve the binary image result with a of gaussian of width=49 and height=3.  The intent was to produce a large filter response in the center of the lane lines. (see line 199, 228)\n",
    "2. For each Y, determine the local maximum in the X-direction in a small window at the expected lane positions. (see line 203 and 228)\n",
    "3. If the maximum value > 0, save the (X,Y) pair to a list of lane-line pixels to fit to a polynomial.  Reject the (X,Y) pair if the maximum value is 0 (i.e. no lane marking found at this Y value) (see line 204)\n",
    "4. Repeat for left and right lanes.\n",
    "5. Fit the lane points to the lane width and a curve representing the lane center (see lines 233:269)\n",
    "6. Extrapolate the left and right lane borders based on the computed lane center and lane width (see line 132)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 requires a bit more explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The lane center is modeled with a second order polynomial \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(y) = Ay^2 + By + C$\n",

    "The lane lines $f_{left}$ and $f_{right}$ are the same polynomial shifted left and right by half the lane width $w$:\n",

    "$f_{left}(y) = Ay^2 + By + C - w/2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_{right}(y) = Ay^2 + By + C + w/2$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters A,B,C and w are unknown, but linear.  Solving in least squares fashion by stacking constraints is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "let $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{\\beta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{\\beta} = [A, B, C, w]$\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{\\hat{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{Y}^T\\mathbf{Y})^{-1}\\mathbf{Y}^T\\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to use this approach in order to fit a curve more robustly to the detected lane points.  I had some trouble fitting the dashed-lane line when there were few datapoints.  Fitting all 4 parameters simultaneously to the measurements proved less prone to sparse lane points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach I implemented to make the fit more robust is including a generated dataset from the curve estimated in the previous frame.  This had the effect of averaging the effect of new measurements with the current estimated lane curve and overcoming instances when thresholding failed or lane pixels were not detected in the correct position."

Then, I used the given curvature equation to compute the curvature from the polynomial coefficients:\n",

None of them panned out too well, and 4 weeks after the deadline, I can't even recall what I tried.  Going back to the basics I pulled together this implementation mostly based on the project instructions.\n",
